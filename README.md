Abstract:
Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) is a promising non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique in future wireless communications. In this letter, a novel uplink codebook optimization method for SCMA using evolution strategies is proposed. Unlike traditional multi-stage codebook designs, we use a single-stage codebook construction method and directly optimizes the entire codebook. Fitness functions suitable for different uplink channels are proposed to jointly optimize various key metrics in the corresponding channels. By comparing our codebooks with various benchmark codebooks, simulation results show that the proposed method can significantly reduce the bit error rate in various uplink channels.
